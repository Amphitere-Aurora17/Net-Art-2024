    <p>Above here is "Daxter" commenting on a post made by a relatively popular cartoon Twitter account.

Sometimes "Daxter" likes to poke his head around to see what these toons are all about, given he's from a video game.</p>

    <p>Daxter expresses his jealously over rival video game Playstation franchise Ratchet and Clank. He doesn't understand why his game didn't have a full-blown Orange Lightning museum in honor of his heroic triumphs.</p>
