    <p>Imagine a time when the only source of entertainment, outside of the television or your Playstation, was your family home computer. What lies underneath the black screen of the monitor? What are some things the computer does better than both television or the Playstation? As you activate the computer, suddenly your mind becomes engrossed by the multitude of interactive media that lies within the internet. There's a sense of clairvoyance you gain as you step, or rather click, onto the prismatic colors that splash across your monitor screen. It's as if it's beckoning you further to take a closer look. You enter your first website and you're greeted with a welcoming message...</p>

    <p>Welcome to the D!giT4l-W0rl!</p>

    <p>Screening Circle provides a collaborative experience that showcases motion-based graphics that change based on wherever the user is hovering their mouse. From clicking on one of the grids, it encourages users to create their own drawings based on Andy Deck’s earlier work Glyphiti. Whatever is left by a previous user can be repurposed by another, creating an interactive, collaborative net art experience.</p>
